# springsteen-archive-covers
Covers for the Bruce Springsteen Archive series. 

THERE IS NO ACTUAL ARCHIVES IN THIS REPO, ONLY THE DIGITAL COVERS THAT WERE EMBEDDED IN THE FILES ORIGINALLY.

All covers acquired from either the archive releases I personally have bought (not that many), by asking around on various online communities, or searching online for the best cover. 

I am still missing nearly all of the 2014 High Hopes tour (see missing.txt), almost every show was 
released except for a few choice ones. Quite a few shows were pulled when the switch 
was made from LiveNation to Nugs. The few not released include:
March Madness (broadcast for free), New Orleans (presumably due to the large number of guests), 
and a show from February (2014-02-16) where Bruce was supposedly drunk from a night of 
partying. Uncasville #2 was released and pulled about a month after 
release for unknown reasons in June 2014.

A note regarding the High Hopes tour: This was the first tour where they set out to record AND release every show on the tour. Shows would be released a little bit after the show itself. Early on they were released on LiveNation with very generic covers (the same exact pic, gray filter, and show info in white text. See 2014-05-18 for an example.) Once they were moved the nugs, they got proper covers with an album appropriate typeface and style. This repo only has the new covers, I'll try and track down the original covers, but its a lesser priority to getting all the nugs covers.

Current count:

1975-2013: Complete

2014: 1 of 27 (the rest are low res 800px)  

2016-17: Complete

2023: In Progress (see "2023list.txt")

So far, I have every cover from the ongoing 2023 tour so far. 1 of them is a full res cover (1500px), and the bulk are slightly lower res 1080x covers. Which seems to be the best I can find floating around. Those 1080x covers are from [Michelle Holme's website](https://michelleholme.com/portfolio/nugs-tour-2023). Some are only 600px covers, and these are not desired, as they aren't great quality. 600px is apparently the new size that the downloads are tagged with, whereas they used to be higher res. Every site that sells the archives also only has 600px covers max with nothing higher.
