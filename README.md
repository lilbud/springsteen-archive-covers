# springsteen-archive-covers
Covers for the Bruce Springsteen Archive series. 

THERE IS NO ACTUAL ARCHIVES IN THIS REPO, ONLY THE DIGITAL COVERS THAT WERE EMBEDDED IN THE FILES ORIGINALLY.

All covers acquired from either the archive releases I personally have bought (not that many), by asking around on various online communities, or searching online for the best cover. 

Current count.

I am still missing nearly all of the 2014 High Hopes tour, almost every show was released except for a few choice ones. Quite a few shows were pulled when the switch was made from LiveNation to Nugs. The few not released include the festival appearances (March Madness and New Orleans), and a show from February where Bruce was supposedly drunk from a night of partying. Uncasville #2 was released and pulled about a month after release in June 2014.
